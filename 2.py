x,y,z=7,2,5
print(pow(x,y,z))


#The `pow(x, y, z)` function in Python calculates the value of `x` 
# to the power of `y`, modulo `z`. In your case, it calculates 7 to the power of 2, and then takes the result modulo 5.

#So, let's break it down step by step:

#1. Calculate 7 to the power of 2: 7^2 = 49.
#2. Take the result modulo 5: 49 % 5 = 4.

#So, the code will output the result, which is 4.
